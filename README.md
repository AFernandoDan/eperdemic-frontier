# ðŸŒŽ Google Globe Trends

Create beautiful and interactive Google Trends globe visualizations with ease.

## About

![image](./demo.gif)

`google-globe-trends` is a [JAMStack][jamstack] application that visualizes Google Trends on an interactive React + ThreeJS globe. Data is fetched during build time using the [`google-trends-api`][google-trends-api] library. Globe visualizations are rendered using the [`react-globe`][react-globe-github] component.

This project is inspired by the wonderful [#metoorising][metoorising] project. With most of interactive features supported by `react-globe`, the project aims to simplify building beautiful globe visualizations with Google Trends datasets.

## Deploy Instance

To deploy your personal Google Globe Trends instance, click on the Deploy to Netlify button below. You will be prompted to connect this instance to a Github repo. Follow through the steps and you should be able to view a working example with your own Netlify URL!

After successfully deploying an instance with Netlify, it is simple to configure how the globe looks and behave, as well as use an entirely different trend dataset.

### Globe Visuals

To configure globe visuals (e.g. globe texture, glow color, zoom behaviors), you can edit the [`config.js`][config-file] file. Please visit the `react-globe` [docs][react-globe-docs] to learn how to configure these options.

### Data

If you would like to render the Google Trends of another keyword, simply change the `data.keyword` field of the[`config.js`][config-file] file.
